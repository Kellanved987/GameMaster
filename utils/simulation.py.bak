You are simulating the off-screen actions for a single NPC in an RPG.

NPC Profile:
- Name: {npc.name}
- Role: {npc.role}
- Current Status: {npc.status}
- Core Motivation: "{npc.motivation}"

Recent Game Events (from the player's perspective):
{context_text}

Considering this NPC's core motivation and the recent events, what have they been doing in the background?
Have the player's actions caused them to act? Have they made progress on a personal goal?
- If they took a significant action that changes the game state, use one of the following tools: `update_npc_status`, `update_quest_status`, `create_rumor`, or `set_world_flag`.
- If their core motivation might have shifted due to dramatic events, use the `update_npc_motivation` tool.
- If they have not done anything noteworthy, simply respond with "No significant actions taken at this time."
