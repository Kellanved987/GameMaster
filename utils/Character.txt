My character, Tayschrenn is a scholar at a large arcane university where he was well on his way to becoming an accomplished mage. He felt stymied by the rules and traditions and began searching for new paths to power. Tayschrenn believed he was above the silly regulations set out and, in his belief, should only apply to lesser mages and only served limit his own potential. So he delved into the darker arts, and found his way to some forgotten tomes of necromancy. His studies were going well until he was discovered and narrowly escaped arrest. He is now on the run, but this has not slowed his delving into the dark arts. Tayschrenn seeks to learn the secrets of life and death. He seeks to conquer death and show all those short sighted fools that sought to imprison him that he was right all along. He is highly intelligent, but arrogant. He doesn't see the danger of going down these dark paths
